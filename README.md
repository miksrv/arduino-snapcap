Arduino SnapCap Firmware
===============
This is a driver project for a simple arduino device (controller + stepper motor) - a motorized telescope cover. This device is intended for amateur astronomy, is mounted on a telescope and allows you to close / open the aperture cover remotely.

It works under the SnapCap protocol, the drivers for which are in EKOS Kstars - the observatory control program (possibly also in ASCOM - the device is public).

### Used devices

- Arduino UNO
- MG995 Servo drive
- DC-DC up (To increase the servo drive current)
